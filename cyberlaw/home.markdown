# Governing the internet: a collaborative, open course and textbook

We are creating a collaborative, free and open textbook about internet law and regulation. Originally created by scholars at Queensland University of Technology School of Law, we welcome contributions from students and academics everywhere. We aim to create a complete university level textbook that embeds entire teaching materials in short, accessible videos.
